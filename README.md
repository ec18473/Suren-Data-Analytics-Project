# Air Quality Analysis & Prediction

This is the code base containing the Jupyter notebooks and datasets used for Data Analytics Mini Project - 2018/19.


This project aims to predict the air quality band for PM2.5 using present and historical pollution data in combination with predicted weather data which is readily available. To solve this problem, firstly, exploratory data analysis will be conducted on available weather and pollution datasets to discover the correlation between different features. After employing suitable data cleaning and feature engineering methods based on the observations made, the feasibility of using different machine learning techniques such as classification and regression models will be analysed.


Throughout this project, several models which can predict Pm2.5 levels and classify them into different pollution bands were experimented and their performance was successfully evaluated. The exploratory data analysis and feature engineering methods implemented for the prediction models revealed interesting correlations between weather and pollution data. We obtained several notable outcomes from the predictive models that are worth being discussed.
Different approaches to handle null values yielded varied performance from each of the models, however simply dropping the records that had null values seemed to be the best approach. Between obtaining the AQI by predicting the PM2.5 values and using a classifier to predict the AQI band straight away, the classifier seemed to perform better. A regression model could be used for applications in data analytics, but it is concluded that classifier models perform better for air quality prediction.
